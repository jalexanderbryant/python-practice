# python-practice
OOP, data structures, algorithms, and small projects written in Python.

# Goals:
* Improve creative process for engineering, software development
* Learn/Practice key data structures and algorithms
* Improve algorthmic problem solving skills
* Improve application development skills

# Books / Study Material
* Learn More Python The Hard Way
..* Use for a few projects, but also to pickup a better approach to software development and creative development

* Data Structures & Algorithms in Python
..* Key Data structure knowledge. Take the learning approaches from LMPTHW and apply it to each data structure.
..* Read daily, implement/practice at least one concept daily

* Think Like a Programmer
..* Read after the first 2, while solving more programming challenges.

* Hackerrank, Leetcoder, etc
..* Use to solve programming challenges to practice problem solving with DS/As

* Udacity - Full Stack Developer Nanodegree
..* End-to-End Application Development practice


# Next Stages....
* Udacity Robotic Software Engineering?
* Udacity Machine Learning or AI? Autonomous Vehicles?
* Polya's How to Solve It
* Cracking the Coding Interview?


# How...
Object Writing - Pick a random word, or random sentence comprised of frivilous words, and write about it for 10 minutes. Do this daily as a warm up. Practice zero judgement, and no self-criticism. Don't get attached to what is written. Discard when done.

# Basic coding process to eliminate friction and get started on a Project/Hack (Do this before coding)
Before each coding practice session...
1. Get computer ready to go
2. Read the description of the task. If you don't have a specific task, create one. Takes notes. Research and gather as much info as possible in written form.
3. Turn the research into a list of what needs to be done to implement the hack. List everything you can think of for the task. What files need to be made? What directories? What data do you need? Features? Libraries?
4. Pick simplest task from TODO list and do it.
5. Check that what you did works.
6. Cross of the list and move to the next step


# A Barebones process to get coding
1. Write out in plain english what the code should do. Write it as a list of tasks.
2. Turn the list of tasks into a comments (# in python)
3. Start at the top, and under each comment. Write the python code that makes it work. Break the mosre abstract comments into smaller comments and repeat as needed.
4. Run the code to make sure it works.


Make it a point to eliminate as much friction as possible. Learn libraries, learn your text editor well, etc.


# Studying Data Structures...
"Memorize, Attempt, Check"
1. Set up all the information and material that describes what you have to retain. Do anything you can to memorize/it. Draw the data sturcture, and it's operations. 
2. Put all the information away where you can't see it.  
3. Attempt to create, from memory, what you need. Try to put anything down right or wrong.
4. After exhausting what you could retain, take what you've done and walk back to your information and compare it. Mark off all the things you got wrong then put your attempt back.
5. Using the list of errors, focus on memorizing so you can correct the erros on the next attempt. Do it all again.

For algorithms
1. Put all the books, notes, and diagrams in one room and your computer in another. Print your code if needed.
2. Spend 15 minutes studying the information in the algorithm room, taking notes, drawing more diagrams, vizualizing how data flows and doing anything else you can think of.
3. Leaving all that info in the algorithm room, walk into the computer room and attempt your implementation from memory. DOn't spend more than 45 minutes on tthis before checking your work.
4. Walk into the algorithm room with your computer and take nottes (that stay in the room) on what you got wrong.
5. Put the laptop back, and go back into the algorithm room, and do another round of memorizing/studyuing before doing it all again. Focus on all the things you got wrong.
